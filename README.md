# Dealership Data pipelines

## Overview
This project implements a complete, end-to-end Data Pipeline (ETL), demonstrating the process of extracting raw data from a public API, transforming it using Python (pandas), loading it into a small portable database (SQLite), and visualizing the results in a Business Intelligence dashboard via Power BI.

The goal is to analyze specific metrics and attributes of various cars fetched from the CarAPI.
